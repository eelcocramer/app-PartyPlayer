## Project home of the webinos PartyPlayer demo

The layout of this project folder is as follows:

        +-- apps                       -> apps, both host and guest
        |
        +-- docs                       -> documentation, incl generated figures
        |
        +-- indexer                    -> the content indexer
        |
        +-- library                    -> shared files
        |
        +-- README.md                  -> this file

### Installing

The PartyPlayer depends on the webinos platform, in particular the App2App API. For now the PartyPlayer is made part of the webinos testbed application. To use PartyPlayer first install the webinos platform then install PartyPlayer in *<WEBINOS_PLATORM>/webinos/web_root* by cloning it from the repository:

*git clone https://github.com/webinos/app-PartyPlayer.git PartyPlayer*

### Indexing your content

To be able to share media items you will have to manually put *mp3* files into the root file system of your PZP following the steps below:

1. Make sure your PZP has been started and connected to a PZH before continuing these steps so that the needed base folder structure is already created.
2. Create the folder that is going to hold your media collection: *mkdir -p ~/.webinos/${HOSTNAME}_Pzp/userData/file/default/partyplayer/collection*
3. Copy the mp3 that you want to share into the newly created folder.
4. Install the indexer pre-requests by executing *npm install* from the indexer folder. Note: this will need [node-canvas](https://github.com/learnboost/node-canvas).
5. Run the indexer by executing: *./indexer.js --lib=$HOME/.webinos/${HOSTNAME}_Pzp/userData/file/default/partyplayer/collection*

When you add more media items to your collection you should always re-run the indexer to have them picked up by the partyplayer.

### Running

The PartyPlayer consists of two parts, that both must be opened in a recent version of firefox, safari, chrome or chromium:

1. Party **Host** front-end at `http://localhost:8080/PartyPlayer/apps/host/index.html`. Use a single instance.
2. Party **Guest** front-end at `http://localhost:8080/PartyPlayer/apps/guest/index.html`. Use as many as you like.

Check out [jira for AppParty](http://jira.webinos.org/browse/APPPARTY) for a complete overview of the product backlog, plans for new features or for issueing bugs.

For details on the implementation please refer to the docs.

### Usage

The Host app is supposed to run large, on a TV screen for example. It plays the media, shows upcoming songs, displays chats and invites people at the party to join in the interactive experience.

The party has to be started by the guest app of the host. For now this is the first guest that arrives and uses the same Personal Zone as the party host uses. All content of this guest is automatically added to the party collection. Once the party host has arrived the party is started and media items can be added to the playlist.

Each guest runs a guest app. Using the app you can share your own music collection with 'Add local items'. Doing so will extend the Collection that is seen by everyone, visually too. Other guests can then proceed to actually 'Add' the content. Note that this scheme requires you to convince others that your shared music should be played!

All music that has been added this way is moved to the funnel. This is where the interaction takes place. Think of simply upvoting your favourites, but also of playing mini games to gain power...

### Specials for 0.8.x branch

The 0.8.x branch is created for demonstration purposes to work in collaboration with Webinos-Platform 0.8.0. For demonstration purposes user icons have been included for the following users:

* web1@victorklos.nl
* web2@victorklos.nl
* web3@victorklos.nl

Please use these mail addresses for the demo accounts.

### Documentation

Building the documentation requires [PlantUML](http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/), [jsdoc-toolkit](https://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/) and [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

#### Building documentation on OSX

1. Download and install [PlantUML](http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/)
2. Create a script to execute PlantUML and add it to your path. Or you can use [this example script](https://gist.github.com/4502562)
3. Install jsdoc-toolkit using [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/): *brew install jsdoc-toolkit*
4. Install markdown using [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/): *brew install markdown*

Good luck!
